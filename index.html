          From class 5 till today, you’ve been a part of my life in ways I can never explain properly 💫❤️. What started as a simple friendship slowly became my biggest blessing. On 27th January 2025, our bond turned into love, and since then every day with you has taught me what real love feels like 💕. We faced so many problems, misunderstandings, and painful arguments, but even on the hardest days, we never gave up on each other 🥺❤️. And honestly, most of our fights end the same way—I become a full-time sorry + please officer 😌🙏, while you reply with your powerful one-word dialogue “ok” 😅 (which is actually more dangerous than shouting). My heart waits for that one smile after the “ok” 😔➡️😊. Around me, you turn into the most childish, cutest human ever 🧸💖, while I pretend to be serious but fail badly 😂. Thank you for choosing me, trusting me, and staying with me through every storm. I may not be perfect, but I promise to love you, protect you, and stand beside you always 🤍✨. I want you to always be happy, no matter what, and I truly wish for your success in everything you dream of. Happy 1st Anniversary, my love. You are my past, my present, and everything I hope for in the future 💗🌙
